# EliteLogs - for admins, by admin.

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e99e7ca-c281-4ad8-a2bc-80145ab9deb2" />


> ‚ú® **EliteLogs** ‚Äî a Minecraft plugin built for server admins who are done with messy, unreadable logs.  
> It neatly records everything that matters: player activity, system events, errors, and warnings.  
> With structured folders and per-player logs, you‚Äôll always know where to look when chaos strikes.  


---

## üì¶ Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SsilensioCrafter/EliteLogs/releases).
2. Drop `EliteLogs.jar` into your `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Pretend you wrote it yourself and flex on your admin friends.

---

## üìñ Usage (TL;DR)

Once the jar is installed you only need two steps:

1. Run `/elogs help` in-game or from console to check command permissions.
2. Tail the `/plugins/EliteLogs/logs/` folder; a subdirectory is created per module automatically.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Reference

Each subcommand is safe to execute live ‚Äî no restarts required.

### `/elogs help`
Prints the localized help page with every subcommand, including any modules that have been disabled in `config.yml` so staff know what to expect.

### `/elogs reload`
Reloads `config.yml`, reinitialises module flags inside the live `LogRouter`, and revalidates the HTTP API token. Use this after editing the config from disk.

### `/elogs inspector`
Captures a full diagnostic snapshot: plugin list, mod list (for modded cores), JVM flags, config hashes, and dumps the report into `logs/inspector/`.

### `/elogs metrics`
Shows live TPS, memory usage, player count, watchdog thresholds, and the status of collectors. Helpful for spotting lag spikes without leaving the game.

### `/elogs export`
Packages the latest logs (or a requested range) into a zip file under `/exports/` for easy sharing. Ideal for sending evidence to other staff.

### `/elogs rotate [force]`
Forces log rotation immediately; with `force` it ignores the minimum interval, otherwise it respects the configured schedule. Archives land in `/logs/archive/` when `logs.archive` is true.

### `/elogs apikey` (alias `/elogs token`)
Admin-only command for the HTTP API. Supports `show`, `status`, and `regenerate` arguments so you can retrieve or rotate the secret without opening the YAML file.

### `/elogs logs [toggle <module>]`
Lists every configured log module with a coloured enabled/disabled indicator sourced from the live router snapshot. Use `toggle <module>` to flip a flag ‚Äî the router is reloaded instantly and the setting persists to `config.yml`.

### `/elogs version`
Reports the plugin version, git commit (if available), and server compatibility information.

### `/elogs session`
Displays the current tracked session summaries, including duration and active players. Use it during events to capture highlights quickly.

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance
- Comprehensive logging: chat, commands, economy, combat, inventory, stats, console, sessions, warnings, errors, disconnects, and more.
- Optional MySQL mirroring writes each log type into its own table (for example `elitelogs_chat` or `elitelogs_errors`) with JSON tag arrays, structured context objects, configurable prefixes, and automatic schema/index upgrades for ultra-fast dashboards and API calls.
- Dedicated `/logs/disconnects` folder captures login denials, kicks, resource-pack responses, and even server disconnect screens (via ProtocolLib when available) with normalized key/value fields (`result`, `ip`, `reason`, `source`, etc.).
- Optional ProtocolLib capture can now be toggled through `logs.disconnects.capture-screen` for hosts that prefer to disable JSON snooping.
- Per-player logs with dedicated folders (`logs/<module>/players/<uuid>`) and session histories (`logs/players/<playerName>/sessions`).
- Global daily logs (`logs/<module>/global-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) for quick server-wide insights.
- Configurable modules ‚Äî enable or disable exactly what you need via `config.yml`.
- Session reports for both server and players, stored separately for better tracking.
- Discord integration: send errors, warnings, sessions, and watchdog alerts directly to your channel.
- Inspector, metrics, suppressor, and watchdog subsystems included out of the box.
- Watchdog can auto-run the inspector, prepare crash reports, and now exposes its full runtime state via the HTTP API.
- Lightweight HTTP API exposes live metrics and recent logs for external dashboards.
- Legacy mode available for flat player log files, if you miss the old days.
- Built-in localization packs (EN, RU, DE, FR, ES) with graceful English fallback for missing keys.
- Written with more caffeine than code ‚Äî but stable enough to trust your server with.

## üß≠ Module & Function Guide

### Logging modules (`logs.types`)
- **warns** ‚Äî records anything elevated via `plugin.getLogger().warning()` or similar API calls.
- **errors** ‚Äî captures stack traces and fatal errors so you can diff recurring crashes.
- **chat** ‚Äî stores public chat, including UUID/name metadata for replaying context.
- **commands** ‚Äî logs every command execution with executor and arguments.
- **players** ‚Äî join/quit flow, teleport summaries, and per-player mirrors when `split-by-player` is enabled.
- **disconnects** ‚Äî the structured pipeline for pre-login denials, login kicks, quits, resource-pack statuses, and (optionally) disconnect screens.
- **combat** ‚Äî PvP/PvE hits, kills, and death context (weapon, attacker, world).
- **inventory** ‚Äî chest access, ender-chest interactions, container movements, shulker loot.
- **economy** ‚Äî Vault-backed balance changes, trades, shop purchases.
- **stats** ‚Äî advancements, statistic milestones, playtime counters.
- **console** ‚Äî a rotating copy of the live console for forensics.
- **rcon** ‚Äî everything executed through remote console connections.
- **suppressed** ‚Äî overflow bucket that stores messages muted elsewhere (handy for auditing filters).

### MySQL storage (`storage.database`)
- `enabled` + credentials: once enabled, every active log type is mirrored without touching the filesystem pipeline.
- `table-prefix`: change the namespace that precedes each per-log table (`elitelogs_chat`, `elitelogs_errors`, ...).
- `flush-interval-ticks`: controls how frequently the async worker flushes queued rows (1 tick = 50‚ÄØms).
- `auto-upgrade`: when true, tables, indexes, and the registry are created/updated automatically on connect so dashboards always have the right shape.
- Schema per table: `occurred_at`, `event_type`, `message`, `player_uuid`, `player_name`, `tags` (JSON array), and `context` (JSON object with category/player/tag keys).
- Registry tables (`<prefix>schema_info`, `<prefix>registry`) are maintained automatically to track schema version and the mapping between categories and tables.

### Disconnect pipeline
- Phases recorded: `prelogin-deny`, `login-deny`, `kick`, `quit`, `resource-pack`, `disconnect-screen`.
- Key/value layout: `[phase] uuid=<...> name=<...> result=<...> reason=<...>` etc. No YAML/JSON parsing required.
- ProtocolLib hook writes both human-readable text and the raw JSON payload for disconnect screens when enabled.
- Player mirrors are synced to `/logs/disconnects/players/<uuid>/` alongside global streams.

### Session reporting
- Global session summaries stored in `/logs/sessions/global/`, refreshed every `sessions.autosave-minutes`.
- Per-player session history (login duration, deaths, economy delta) written to `/logs/sessions/players/<uuid>/`.
- Triggered automatically on join/quit and when watchdog fires to capture the current state.

### HTTP API
- `api.auth-token` auto-generates on first launch; `/elogs apikey` exposes management options.
- Endpoints provide status, metrics, watchdog insights, and streamed log buffers.
- Rate limiting is handled by the in-memory log buffer size (`api.log-history`).

### Discord alerts
- `discord.send` block lets you enable granular topics: errors, warnings, sessions, watchdog, inspector.
- Rate-limiter prevents spam by enforcing `discord.rate-limit-seconds` between posts.

### Watchdog automation
- Fires when TPS drops below `watchdog.tps-threshold` or errors exceed `watchdog.error-threshold`.
- Automatically runs the inspector, generates crash reports, and notifies Discord (if configured).

### üîå Disconnect log format

- Every entry is emitted as `[phase] key=value ‚Ä¶` so scripts and SIEM pipelines can parse them easily.
- Phases: `prelogin-deny`, `login-deny`, `kick`, `quit`, `resource-pack`, and `disconnect-screen` (ProtocolLib).
- Common keys include `result`, `ip`, `source`, `cause`, `status`, `reason`, and `raw-json` (disconnect screen payloads).
- Per-player mirrors are written to `logs/disconnects/players/<uuid>/global-YYYY-MM-DD.log` when `split-by-player` is enabled.

## üß© Version compatibility
| Range | What works |
| --- | --- |
| 1.8.x ‚Äì 1.12.x | Listeners use reflection for `getItemInMainHand` and legacy pickup events (`PlayerPickupItemEvent`), so the build retains full inventory functionality even on older server cores. |
| 1.13.x ‚Äì 1.20.6 | Modern events (`EntityPickupItemEvent`) and the collection-based `Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()` are used when available, without breaking on older versions. |
| 1.21.x | Simply build the project with the `spigot-api:1.21.x` dependency ‚Äî the compatibility layer continues to work without changes, you only need to run tests. |

---

## üåê Localization
- Ships with translated message packs for English, Russian, German, French, and Spanish.
- Set the `language` key in `config.yml` to swap bundles; the plugin falls back to English if a string is missing.
- Custom translations can be dropped into `plugins/EliteLogs/lang/<code>.yml` ‚Äî they take precedence over the bundled files on reload.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- [x] Add Warn & Reports logging  
- [ ] Database support  
- [ ] Fancy web panel (because who doesn‚Äôt love dashboards)
- [ ] Maybe AI log summarizer (so ChatGPT can tell you who‚Äôs sus)

---

## üîå HTTP API
EliteLogs ships with an optional HTTP server so your SsilensioWeb admin panel (or any other dashboard) can pull data straight from the plugin. Enable it by flipping the `api.enabled` flag in `config.yml` and adjusting the bind address/port if needed.

### Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/status` ‚Äî plugin version, enabled modules, and configuration flags.
- `GET /api/v1/metrics` ‚Äî live TPS/CPU/memory plus the active session counters and watchdog thresholds.
- `GET /api/v1/watchdog` ‚Äî watchdog thresholds, trigger timings, error counters, and the most recent trigger reason.
- `GET /api/v1/logs` ‚Äî list of log categories currently buffered in memory.
- `GET /api/v1/logs/<category>?limit=100` ‚Äî most recent lines for a category (limit defaults to the configured `log-history`).

### Authentication
- Leave `auth-token` empty and EliteLogs will auto-generate a strong token on startup; use `/elogs apikey show` (or `regenerate`) to reveal or rotate it safely.
- Provide the token via the `X-API-Key` header (preferred) or the `token` query parameter.
- `log-history` controls how many lines are cached per category for instant API responses.
- Bind the server to `127.0.0.1` when using a reverse proxy; use `0.0.0.0` only if you really want to expose it publicly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config
Yes, it has a config. Even your laziest admin can use it:

### Version metadata
- `version` is stamped during the build so the YAML always matches the jar you are running. Leave it untouched; `/elogs reload` will rewrite the value after you deploy an update.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

1. Make sure JDK 8+ and Maven are installed.
2. Run `mvn -f EliteLogs/pom.xml -DskipTests package` from the repository root (or `cd EliteLogs` first and run `mvn -DskipTests package`).
   - Minimal ProtocolLib 5.1.0 APIs live in `EliteLogs/src/stubs/java`; the build helper adds them during compilation and the jar plugin excludes them from the final artifact. Production servers still need the real ProtocolLib plugin to capture DISCONNECT packets.
