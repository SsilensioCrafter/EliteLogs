> ✨ **EliteLogs** — a Minecraft plugin built for server admins who are done with messy, unreadable logs.  
> It neatly records everything that matters: player activity, system events, errors, and warnings.  
> With structured folders and per-player logs, you’ll always know where to look when chaos strikes.

## 📖 Usage

- `/elogs help` → show this help message  
- `/elogs reload` → reload the plugin configuration  
- `/elogs inspector` → run the Inspector for quick analysis of sessions, chat, commands, and errors  
- `/elogs metrics` → display logging metrics and statistics  
- `/elogs export` → export logs into external-friendly formats  
- `/elogs rotate [force]` → archive old logs (add `force` to rotate immediately)  
- `/elogs logs` → list available log categories (chat, commands, sessions, etc.)  
- `/elogs version` → show the current plugin version

## ✨ Features
- Comprehensive logging: chat, commands, economy, combat, inventory, stats, console, sessions, warnings, errors, and more.
- Per-player logs with dedicated folders (`logs/<module>/players/<uuid>`) and session histories (`logs/players/<playerName>/sessions`).
- Global daily logs (`logs/<module>/global-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) for quick server-wide insights.
- Configurable modules — enable or disable exactly what you need via `config.yml`.
- Session reports for both server and players, stored separately for better tracking.
- Discord integration: send errors, warnings, sessions, and watchdog alerts directly to your channel.
- Inspector, metrics, suppressor, and watchdog subsystems included out of the box.
- Legacy mode available for flat player log files, if you miss the old days.
- Built-in localization packs (EN, RU, DE, FR, ES) with graceful English fallback for missing keys.
- Written with more caffeine than code — but stable enough to trust your server with.

## 🧩 Version compatibility
| Range | What works |
| --- | --- |
| 1.8.x – 1.12.x | Listeners use reflection for `getItemInMainHand` and legacy pickup events (`PlayerPickupItemEvent`), so the build retains full inventory functionality even on older server cores. |
| 1.13.x – 1.20.6 | Modern events (`EntityPickupItemEvent`) and the collection-based `Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()` are used when available, without breaking on older versions. |
| 1.21.x | Simply build the project with the `spigot-api:1.21.x` dependency — the compatibility layer continues to work without changes, you only need to run tests. |

## 🌐 Localization
- Ships with translated message packs for English, Russian, German, French, and Spanish.
- Set the `language` key in `config.yml` to swap bundles; the plugin falls back to English if a string is missing.
- Custom translations can be dropped into `plugins/EliteLogs/lang/<code>.yml` — they take precedence over the bundled files on reload.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [x] Add Warn & Reports logging  
- [ ] Database support  
- [ ] Fancy web panel (because who doesn’t love dashboards)  
- [ ] Maybe AI log summarizer (so ChatGPT can tell you who’s sus)
