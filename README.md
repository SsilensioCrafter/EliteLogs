> ‚ú® **EliteLogs** ‚Äî a Minecraft plugin built for server admins who are done with messy, unreadable logs.  
> It neatly records everything that matters: player activity, system events, errors, and warnings.  
> With structured folders and per-player logs, you‚Äôll always know where to look when chaos strikes.

## ‚ú® Features
- Comprehensive logging: chat, commands, economy, combat, inventory, stats, console, sessions, warnings, errors, disconnects, and more.
- Dedicated `/logs/disconnects` folder captures login denials, kicks, resource-pack responses, and even server disconnect screens (via ProtocolLib when available) with normalized key/value fields (`result`, `ip`, `reason`, `source`, etc.).
- Optional ProtocolLib capture can now be toggled through `logs.disconnects.capture-screen` for hosts that prefer to disable JSON snooping.
- Per-player logs with dedicated folders (`logs/<module>/players/<uuid>`) and session histories (`logs/players/<playerName>/sessions`).
- Global daily logs (`logs/<module>/global-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) for quick server-wide insights.
- Configurable modules ‚Äî enable or disable exactly what you need via `config.yml`.
- Session reports for both server and players, stored separately for better tracking.
- Discord integration: send errors, warnings, sessions, and watchdog alerts directly to your channel.
- Inspector, metrics, suppressor, and watchdog subsystems included out of the box.
- Watchdog can auto-run the inspector, prepare crash reports, and now exposes its full runtime state via the HTTP API.
- Lightweight HTTP API exposes live metrics and recent logs for external dashboards.
- Legacy mode available for flat player log files, if you miss the old days.
- Built-in localization packs (EN, RU, DE, FR, ES) with graceful English fallback for missing keys.
- Written with more caffeine than code ‚Äî but stable enough to trust your server with.

### üîå Disconnect log format

- Every entry is emitted as `[phase] key=value ‚Ä¶` so scripts and SIEM pipelines can parse them easily.
- Phases: `prelogin-deny`, `login-deny`, `kick`, `quit`, `resource-pack`, and `disconnect-screen` (ProtocolLib).
- Common keys include `result`, `ip`, `source`, `cause`, `status`, `reason`, and `raw-json` (disconnect screen payloads).
- Per-player mirrors are written to `logs/disconnects/players/<uuid>/global-YYYY-MM-DD.log` when `split-by-player` is enabled.

## üß© Version compatibility
| Range | What works |
| --- | --- |
| 1.8.x ‚Äì 1.12.x | Listeners use reflection for `getItemInMainHand` and legacy pickup events (`PlayerPickupItemEvent`), so the build retains full inventory functionality even on older server cores. |
| 1.13.x ‚Äì 1.20.6 | Modern events (`EntityPickupItemEvent`) and the collection-based `Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()` are used when available, without breaking on older versions. |
| 1.21.x | Simply build the project with the `spigot-api:1.21.x` dependency ‚Äî the compatibility layer continues to work without changes, you only need to run tests. |

---

## üåê Localization
- Ships with translated message packs for English, Russian, German, French, and Spanish.
- Set the `language` key in `config.yml` to swap bundles; the plugin falls back to English if a string is missing.
- Custom translations can be dropped into `plugins/EliteLogs/lang/<code>.yml` ‚Äî they take precedence over the bundled files on reload.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- [x] Add Warn & Reports logging  
- [ ] Database support  
- [ ] Fancy web panel (because who doesn‚Äôt love dashboards)
- [ ] Maybe AI log summarizer (so ChatGPT can tell you who‚Äôs sus)

---

## üîå HTTP API
EliteLogs ships with an optional HTTP server so your SsilensioWeb admin panel (or any other dashboard) can pull data straight from the plugin. Enable it by flipping the `api.enabled` flag in `config.yml` and adjusting the bind address/port if needed.

### Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/status` ‚Äî plugin version, enabled modules, and configuration flags.
- `GET /api/v1/metrics` ‚Äî live TPS/CPU/memory plus the active session counters and watchdog thresholds.
- `GET /api/v1/watchdog` ‚Äî watchdog thresholds, trigger timings, error counters, and the most recent trigger reason.
- `GET /api/v1/logs` ‚Äî list of log categories currently buffered in memory.
- `GET /api/v1/logs/<category>?limit=100` ‚Äî most recent lines for a category (limit defaults to the configured `log-history`).

### Authentication
- Leave `auth-token` empty and EliteLogs will auto-generate a strong token on startup; use `/elogs apikey show` (or `regenerate`) to reveal or rotate it safely.
- Provide the token via the `X-API-Key` header (preferred) or the `token` query parameter.
- `log-history` controls how many lines are cached per category for instant API responses.
- Bind the server to `127.0.0.1` when using a reverse proxy; use `0.0.0.0` only if you really want to expose it publicly.
